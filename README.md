# maze-creator

I guess this will be an app where you can create a maze, and you will have a thing that solves it for you, or you can control a character to try to solve it yourself (but since you made the maze it will be easy for you)

todo:

- make select and drop system, so I can place down walls for the maze DONE
- make a "tile type selector" next to the grid, so I can choose between wall and starting point (to place down) DONE
- make a system to save mazes
- make a player
- make a simple player controller system
- make a bot that solves the maze ( :) )
